The system itself (backend):
Problem:
    How do you calculate chest, waist, thigh size without a measuring tape. 
        - HARD:
        - Are there any anatomically mathematical formulas that could discard the tape?
        - Can we use smartphone technology in some way that could do the measurements?
        - EASY:
        - Or should it be based on likelihood, with previous appeal preferences? 

User: 
    If the user already owns clothing they are happy with, then use that appeal as a reference. 
    If not? Measuring Tape? 

Admin: 
    Need to provide information of the size grades for each size (xs, s, m, l, xl etc..)
    Category of the appeal and its sub-category (e.g. category: cycling, sub-category: dirt)


Meeting with Manikas:
5-10 ways of already existing solutions. (ways of measuring, measuring tape, easysize etc..)

Discover the architecture. If there is no academic litterature, then look at the technology itself. 

We need to conduct experiments. The experiment will end in a validation. For example, the traditional way versus our application. The amount of time, and thoughts of the process etc. Such that we have empirical data. 

Who owns the product. 

Discover the startup.

Can you make the measuring generic?

How much machine learning is there? How much is low tech and how much is high tech? 

How much data is needed? Incentive driven questions, the question seems irrational, 

Experiement result: If very little machine learning, then try machine learning or AI. 

By june: we know what is out there, and we have an idea of what we want to do.
