The system itself (backend):
Problem:
    How do you calculate chest, waist, thigh size without a measuring tape. 
        - HARD:
        - Are there any anatomically mathematical formulas that could discard the tape?
        - Can we use smartphone technology in some way that could do the measurements?
        - EASY:
        - Or should it be based on likelihood, with previous appeal preferences? 

User: 
    If the user already owns clothing they are happy with, then use that appeal as a reference. 
    If not? Measuring Tape? 

Admin: 
    Need to provide information of the size grades for each size (xs, s, m, l, xl etc..)
    Category of the appeal and its sub-category (e.g. category: cycling, sub-category: dirt)
